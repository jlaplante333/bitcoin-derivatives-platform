### 🏭 Industrial Applications
- Grid stabilization
- Peak shaving
- Renewable integration
- **Bitcoin mining operations**

## 🎛️ Features

### Control Panel
- **Charge Threshold**: Energy price below which the battery will charge
- **Discharge Threshold**: Energy price above which the battery will discharge
- **Start/Stop Monitoring**: Control the real-time monitoring system
- **Update Thresholds**: Change thresholds without restarting
- **Reset Battery**: Reset battery to initial state (50% charge)
- **Battery Info**: View detailed LG battery specifications

### Real-time Status
- **Battery Status**: Current charge level, capacity, and operational state
- **Price Data**: Live energy, hash, and token prices from the API
- **Latest Decision**: Most recent battery action and reasoning

### Decision History
- **Historical Decisions**: Last 10 battery decisions with timestamps
- **Action Types**: 
  - 🟢 **CHARGE**: Battery charging when energy is cheap
  - 🔴 **DISCHARGE**: Battery discharging when energy is expensive
  - 🟡 **HOLD**: Battery holding when prices are normal

## 🔧 API Endpoints

The UI communicates with the battery system through these REST endpoints:

- `GET /api/status` - Get current battery and price status
- `GET /api/decisions` - Get decision history
- `GET /api/battery_info` - Get detailed LG battery specifications
- `POST /api/start` - Start monitoring with specified thresholds
- `POST /api/stop` - Stop monitoring
- `POST /api/update_thresholds` - Update charge/discharge thresholds
- `POST /api/reset_battery` - Reset battery to initial state

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Price Monitoring**: Fetches real-time prices from the Mara API every 5 minutes
2. **Decision Making**: Battery system analyzes energy prices against thresholds
3. **Action Execution**: Automatically charges, discharges, or holds based on prices
4. **Real-time Updates**: UI refreshes every 5 seconds with latest data

## 🎯 Bitcoin Mining Use Cases

### Energy Arbitrage
- **Low Energy Prices**: Battery charges to store cheap energy
- **High Energy Prices**: Battery discharges to avoid expensive energy
- **Normal Prices**: Battery holds to maintain operational readiness

### Mining Optimization
- **Hash Price High**: Discharge battery to power mining operations
- **Token Price High**: Discharge battery to power inference operations
- **Energy Price Low**: Charge battery for future use

### Risk Management
- **Price Volatility**: Battery acts as a buffer against price spikes
- **Grid Stability**: Smooths energy consumption patterns
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimizes total energy costs over time

## 💰 Cost Benefits for Bitcoin Mining

### Energy Cost Reduction
- **20-40% cost savings** through energy arbitrage
- **Peak shaving** during high-demand periods
- **Load shifting** to low-cost energy windows

### Operational Benefits
- **Backup power** during grid outages
- **Grid stability** compliance
- **Renewable integration** capabilities
- **Carbon footprint reduction**

### ROI Analysis
- **Typical payback period**: 3-5 years
- **ROI improvement**: 15-25% for mining operations
- **Risk mitigation**: Reduced exposure to energy price volatility

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Conservative Strategy
- Charge Threshold: 1.2 (charge when energy is very cheap)
- Discharge Threshold: 2.5 (discharge only when energy is very expensive)
- Result: More conservative, less frequent actions

### Scenario 2: Aggressive Strategy
- Charge Threshold: 1.8 (charge more frequently)
- Discharge Threshold: 1.9 (discharge more frequently)
- Result: More active trading, potentially higher returns

### Scenario 3: Balanced Strategy
- Charge Threshold: 1.7 (default)
- Discharge Threshold: 2.0 (default)
- Result: Balanced approach with moderate activity

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Backend**: Python HTTP server with JSON API
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with real-time updates
